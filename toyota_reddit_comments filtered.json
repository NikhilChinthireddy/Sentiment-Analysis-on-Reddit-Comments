It was 13 years old and had 25K miles.\n\nBattery failed 3 months after he bought it.  So that is a thing.\n\nIf you are NOT going to drive it often, then sell it NOW.  Don't keep it if it is an extra car that only gets driven occasionally.  \n\n80K miles is nothing for these cars.  Hybrid car engines lead very sedate lives.  Always running around 1700 rpm.  This car will go 300K mile with good maintenance, as long as you drive it often.",

So unless the 4Runner gonna be SUPER cheap compared to the 250 series... i doubt it. \n\nIf anything I would see it merged with the Tacoma so you have Fortuner / Hilux and 4Runner/Tacoma, with the latter built all in North america...",

It is markedly better than the previous Gen Tacoma and the current runner inside but still not nearly as nice as the new tundra. Time will tell if the new landcruiser is going to have a nicer interior that is less cheaply built and feel but I don’t have high hopes for it or the 25 runner",

Worst of them all was the luxurious Montero SR, which was uber expensive and had plenty of buyers like pricey Trooper Limited. SUV prices got worse when they added carlike dashboards to install dual airbags in the mid-90s. Gen 1 Rodeo/Passport were also stupidly expensive by 1996.\n\n\nhttps://www.motortrend.com/reviews/1996-mitsubishi-montero/\n\n\n\nThe 1995.5 Tacoma V6 XtraCab was about $30k+ loaded with every option in March 1995. Gen 3 4Runner was even more expensive a year later, some pricing out at $34-35k or more! \n\n\n4Runner has oddly grown into a plaything for upper middle class professionals, whereas as the Land Cruiser 80 was even higher and shot up sharply in price during the 90s (especially with FZJ80) because celebrities were buying them and paying over sticker before the LX 450 came out in 1996.\n\n\nToyota of the 90s nearly rivaled Land Rover in prestige, in being higher quality SUVs with good ground clearance and excellent fit & finish.",

My 2012 Sequoia has a curvy ass with a power window.  \n\nActually, in my humble opinion, the flatter the bottom half of the rear door is, the *less likely* it is to have a power rear window.  This is because the top half of the door on the new 4runner (the part that includes the window) will almost certainly have a slant to some degree.  If you look at the side profile of the new Sequoia, you can see the problem with glass moving from the top half to the bottom half.  It has no where to go.  Same applies to new models with less aggressive rear profiles - like the GX and LC.   \n\nIf the bottom half of the rear door is vertically flat, then the top half also has to be really close to flat.  Which Toyota will not do, it would be awful aerodynamics.  I’d wager good money the new 4Runners move away from power window to a hatch type window.",

The same cannot be said of dealers; there are honest ones and there are ones that are straight up crooks.\n\nSounds like the *dealer* you spoke to is closer to the crook end of the spectrum.",

I wouldn’t sell a rav4 currently for less than TSRP right now, unless it’s the last day of the month and we were one car away from our objective. But I am whoring out crowns, venzas, tundras over 60k and certain Corolla crosses. I would not expect to walk out of the store though with a new rav unless you got a hybrid or limited, and are going to a le or xle.",

Finally, when we did test drive a RAV4, it was the worst driving experience I've ever had.

I finally settled on a Subaru Outback and I love it.",

That's why they always try to sell dealer financing and a bunch of extras.\n\nOn a used car they've given $2,000 trade in value (and jacked the new car price to cover most or all of that) then run it through detailing and park it on the lot for $6,000. Nearly $4K profit and most of the time they just had to wash and vacuum it.\n\nLast car my uncle traded in, he'd just put new tires on and I replaced the O2 sensor. It also had a cracked windshield. Aside from that it was perfect.\n\nDealer gave him $1,500. A week later it was on the lot with $5,000 on a new windshield, sold very quickly.\n\nA friend worked at that dealer for a while and was very good at selling used cars. They kept wanting him to move to new sales but \"Why would I want a pay cut?\". Salesman pay was a % of the net so he'd have to sell a lot more new cars just to make as much as he did in used sales.",

That's kinda where I'm at.\n\nIn 2020 during covid, I was able to snag a 2014 Ford Expedition EL with 154k for $8,275 after taxes/fees. I got hit in a parking lot by a 16 year old and got an additional $1,200 check for some quarter panel damage about a year into owning it as a nice bonus.\n\nRealistically, it's probably worth what I paid roughly still with 184,000 miles on it now.\n\nIt gets an awful 13 mpg. But, I've got heated seats, leather, it runs fine, and I'm pretty happy with it otherwise. \n\nI'd like better gas mileage but there's no reasonable way for me to get out of a perfectly fine car that's paid off to get something with better gas mileage.\n\nI'm looking at it at this point like I'm probably stuck with this car until something absolutely catastrophic happens, which could easily be another decade.\n\nI'd like something that's more like 25-30MPG, I'd take something like a newer AWD crossover... but the used price on stuff is inflated (plus risk of getting a dud), and the new prices are stupid now. \n\nWith gas at $3.50+ a gallon right now driving even short distances is a noticeable price lol.",

Sell your car when you have the opportunity to get money out of it. Sometimes it's now, sometimes it's not. But if all you've got is an old rust bucket, then you're stuck throwing an increasing amount of repair money each year at an increasingly shitty car for the last ten years of its life. Maybe there's some protestant pride in self-deprivation there, but a blanket statement of \"always be a better ROI\" is in my experience easily falsifiable.\n\nI sell my computers every 2-3 years while they still have some value, and do the same with cars. They're all just assets. Don't buy brand new, don't pay too much, and sell for as much as you can while the item is still desirable. \n\nBut if you want to live on 20 year old Corollas and Lima beans, you do you.",

Most people don't care to, dont know how to, or are too impatient to search for hidden gems in the used car market, so it's much easier short term to just buy brand new with money you don't have. I've always bought with saved cash, so now it's pretty easy to tell the nuanced value of a used car within a couple minutes. \n\nI could easily got finance anything, but I like not owing a bank just for my transportation.",

I'm pretty much stuck with mine, but that's okay because it's fully loaded and fun to drive. Mpg? Yea, I only pay attention to smiles per gallon, which is quite high even tho my gas tanks last 180-200 miles, haha. You could compare your high fuel costs to a new car payment, but yea at least you're able to pick and choose when you get gas bills vs having rhe bank come a calling every month, or else! \n\nYou could start saving cash for another 8 grand vehicle and, this time, pick something smaller/lighter for better mpg. Whatever value is left on the truck can go back in your pocket via private sale, and then you're a hella lot wiser this time around your next purchase. You're able to find something better,nicer condition, and more suited to your needs as you did well sticking it out in the current truck. Win win! \n\nThe hard part is being able to check out a used car, and know how much value it's got left. Once you get good at that and knowing the ins and outs of the specific vehicle you want, the used car market is your oyster! \n\nIn the meantime, you have mostly reliable transportation and no monthly expenses other than fuel and insurance! You're killing it! \n\nI'd be happy to help you when you're ready for a change as well. Cheers man",

It sat on their lot for six months as they kept ticking the price lower. Turns out when you target a clientele that's shopping for bling trucks, hardly anyone looking for a nice, affordable, basic truck bothers to even think about checking out your ads or lot.\n\nThe best used car deals tend to be found out of place, like buying a 2009 Prius for $4K cash at a Honda dealer. Dealers want all the not their brand used cars gone as fast as possible. Who goes Toyota shopping at a Honda dealer? Cruise the GM lots if a used Ford is your desire.",

I have yet to own a new or CPO import vehicle I wasn't able to get to 250,000+ miles before I basically gave it away in great mechanical condition. 🤷🏽‍♂️\n\nMaintence and up keep is very low cost and for the most part simple to DIY. Toyota service centers are reasonably price if you shop around. Plenty of trust worthy Indy shops exist too!\n\nMy Cali cars don't rust, my NJ/NY cars don't rust much and one has 199k miles on a 2008 year BMW 335xi which did daily duty in the north east snow for the first 105k miles (8 years).\n\nOnce the vehicle is paid off, what is your biggest expense to remain road worthy? Oil change is about $70, Tires are maybe $1000 every 5 years or so. I have lifetime alignment plans for $190 at firestone, Brake fluid flush is like $100 every 5 years. Transmission/diffs fluid flush is like $500 every 50k or 100k miles. Coolant flush is a simple DIY every 50k miles. Car battery is maybe <$200 every 8 years. Front suspension wears out at about 100k miles and the rear suspension about 200k miles. shocks/struts maybe every 100k miles. Cost of fuel... insurance is like $800/year/vehicle and thats with a maxed out policy that cannot be improved upon in any way (Doesn't matter if it is a <$20k value vehicle or greater than $100k+ value vehicle... my rates always seem to be able the same across all vehicles 🤷🏽‍♂️",

It was a long bed without power steering.  It had a/c but roll up windows and none of the safety features we take for granted.  No airbags, back up cameras.  Not only did people use them as work trucks, but they were entry-level vehicles which allowed young people and those without a lot of money to get a new vehicle which was going to last forever.  They were great if you wanted to throw a shell on the back or modify in other ways.  There was a funny quirk at the time.  In order to get around some import law, they were sold without bumpers and you had to get one as an add on.  And yes, I got between 25 and 30 MPG.",

With the 2nd and 3rd row seats out, I used the seat mounting points as tie-down points for the bike.  I was literally able to fit all my riding gear, my tools, and track-specific equipment in it, without any problems.  If I did that with a truck I would have had to tie down everything in the back (as in, not just the bike) to make sure it wouldn't fly away.  But with the van, I just secured the heaviest stuff (the bike and generator) to keep it from shifting and everything was safe because it was enclosed.  And most pickups nowadays won't even fit the bike itself without the tailgate being open.\n\nThe early 2000s Toyota Sienna I mentioned in my first comment?  Still got it.  It spends most of the year with the 2nd and 3rd row seats in storage.  I can fit a full-sized ladder in there.  Trips to the plumbing supply shop or lumberyard are a breeze.  There hasn't been a single home improvement project in over a decade that it couldn't handle.  And once every couple of years the seats go back in so my sister can use it with her family when they visit our parents.\n\nI like the way most of the Toyota trucks have looked over the years.  But when I seriously consider the utility of one, none of them win against a van.  Maybe if I lived on a farm and was driving it through fields and orchards I would feel differently.  But I'm not, and neither are most of the people driving trucks around me.",

I really do not understand why auto manufacturers think this is sustainable, people are just not going to be buying new cars anymore.\n\nDuring covid yea sure, but now even when I pass the ford dealership next to me, the lot is FILLED with broncos. Broncos had similar waitlists during covid, and were impossible to find. What exactly is Toyota or the dealers doing with these cars? Putting them in an off-site lot and trickling them in? I am seeing new 23 Tacomas pop up in dealerships near me, where were these cars hidden? Really interested in opening the door to see the manufacture dates on those.\n\nEven if you look at production numbers, Toyota is nearly back up to pre-covid levels. With nearly double the interest rates, how is it possible that demand is still the same? I am calling BS on this. Dealerships need to go ASAP.",

The build quality on the broncos is surprisingly good, but the 2.3 ecoboost is kinda harsh at idle compared to the same engine in a ranger. The vibration resonates with a bunch of body panels and makes it feel worse than it is. Now the f150s on the other hand I'm 100% convinced will be getting new recalls soon. I'd say about 40% of the ones I drive with the 3.5 or 3.7 ecoboost have fucked up transmissions with <20mi on the odometer. Like get in and it pops up \"park unavailable, apply parking brake before exiting\" and it pops up again and chirps at you any time you go below 5mph. Most of those also have no idea what gear to be in, will redline in 1st then fall on their face in 7th then downshift and string out 3rd then get stuck in 5th and almost stall coming to a stop. Sometimes they'll rev hang and keep accelerating harder after you let off the gas then go about 5 seconds of dead pedal before it'll do anything again. 0/10 would not recommend an ecoboost 2024 f150. I love the handling of the rangers, id take a 2.3 over a 3.5 though. Not sure why but they feel faster and more nimble, like the extra power of the 3.5 doesn't overcome it's extra weight combined with the extra interior goodies included in the higher trims that usually have the 3.5. And on that note, the broncos handle incredibly well but are stupid slow for having the same drivetrain options, a 2.3 ranger is faster than even a 3.7 bronco. If you're gonna go with an f150, I'm in love with the 3.5 powerboost. I haven't had a single one with issues yet, on a 18mi run I average like 29-34mpg depending on how I drive it compared to like 13-17 in a 3.7 ecoboost, 14-19 in a 3.5 ecoboost, like 12 consistently in a 5.0 whether it's in sport having fun or eco babying it. The lightnings are amazing to drive but I wouldn't buy one unless they like triple the battery pack size, $80k window sticker price for 200mi range at full charge in eco is insane. Give it a like 350kwh pack and I'd sell body parts for a lightning platinum. There's a bunch of f150 LOBOs on some of the lots we go to but I haven't gotten to drive one yet, today they found out I know how to drive manual and was stuck in 7 speed/2.3 ecoboost broncos the rest of the day because I'm one of 2 people across 5 vans of 10 drivers each that can drive manual and they had a whole line that needed moved.",

The only answer that I have received was to go buy from a dealer that doesn't mark up. YOU CAN'T. The LC First Edition is extremely limited and you won't find one.

Used cars appreciated because demand exceeded supply which is business 101 and only unusual because that doesn't happen often in the car industry. Markups existed before the pandemic, they just weren't as egregious and low rates plus negotiable dealers made them less noteworthy. New care inventory is building sure but it's nowhere near where it was pre-pandemic and it's unlikely it ever will. I guarantee you there are no new car stores \"camping on inventory\". I couldn't sell you a new Sienna or Sequoia right now for invoice if I wanted to because they FLY off the transporters. The Landcruiser will be even worse. If you feel a vehicle is more expensive than suits your taste, fine. To say someone is being ripped off continues to be a silly sentiment to me. I'd rather pay 80K for a Toyota product I'll likely be able to drive for a decade plus than a BMW that I'll get laughed at if I didn't lease.",

You could actually save money by looking at the GX460 or GX550, as those are just Prados in a suit.  And at this price level, you could also look at the LX or TX if you can find a good price.\n\nAlthough I would argue Land Cruiser Prados in general are ridiculously overpriced.  If the criteria is reasonable ownership costs and 300,000, there are much more competitive Toyota and Lexus models that fit that bill.",

Those have appreciated. Everything else really hasn't especially common things like Land cruisers. Some of the old '60s ones have also picked up but it's again because it's a very low production car and there aren't many nice ones left. Modern common high production cars do not appreciate and you dealers that think you're going to bend people over are either going to have to adapt or go out of business, the choice is yours.

That reinforces that such a scenario can increase the asking price of a vehicle beyond even its original price. So long as that is the case the market will reflect the average price given those circumstances. You're right modern high production common cars don't appreciate but no one is getting \"bent over\" when buying them.\n \nSomething is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. No one is owed a car. It's a commodity, in a way, and as long as the terms and figures are agreeable, then all parties should be satisfied. Someone paying more than you would does not mean they were taken advantage of. If that were the case you wouldn't step foot in a grocery store without a fistful of coupons.  I can assure you dealerships are adapting. Common cars like the Prius are sparsely available (at the moment) comparative to what they once were so there's a premium on them that will likely only last until the demand matches or falls short of supply. Such is the ebb and flow of business based on market forces.",

That chain is fine. Toyota chains are durable and do not stretch. The only way the chain would need to be replaced is if the motor got too hot and caused the metal to expand and lose the paint marks on the chain, otherwise the chain is still good to use.\n\nShe needs to work along side a master technician for a while.",

It is extremely uncommon for the chain to wear out first however it's ALWAYS good form to replace all parts of a system you're replacing some already important parts on. \n\nUnless budget is an issue you really don't want to skimp on a chain if you can help it. \n\nA stretched chain can occur. Any metal can stretch, especially when it's inside a hot metal box soaking in hot oil for it's entire life. \n\nYou sound like a terribly misinformed shade tree mechanic trying to talk down to someone else.",

Walk away and find a dealer that won’t steal 16500 from you.\n\nIf they want to sell the car, they’ll play ball. If not, go find someone else that will.\n\nI did this exact thing for a Toyota hybrid and saved 5k of bullshit markup and worthless “dealer accessories”. They tried to make me negotiate against myself, but I kept saying, “I’m ready to make a deal at this actual MSRP number. If you want a deal, that’s what it’s going to take.”\n\nYou have to be serious and ready to purchase. And it has to be a car on the lot. They don’t need to cave for cars in production or transit because they still have a chance to convince someone else to pay the extra 5k or 15k. Be patient and watch inventory.",

I have owned two Toyotas and I have had numerous personal dealings with Envision Toyota in Milpitas and have nothing but wonderful things to say about them. I believe they actually care --- which is a lot to say about any business. I wish you the best going forward but in the future I would recommend getting someone’s verbal permission to record them.

I guess they want consumers to think of Toyota as hip cars not a company that makes taxis. I think it would be pretty cool to see a commercial in the exact scenario you experienced. Show a person arriving from their flight at an airport, hailing a taxi and asking the driver how many miles he has on his Prius. Then the passenger tells the driver to make a stop. Cuts to the passenger being dropped off at a Toyota dealership, buying a new Prius and then driving it home to surprise his/her child going off to college with a new car.",

Only issues with scraping the bumper and things that came up through my neglect. It isn't quiet inside but grabs the road and I don't drive it easy, setting cruise at 140km/h or taking gravel roads is not uncommon.\nIt shows it's age considering 2 people learned to drive in it but I don't want to replace it considering how good a vehicle it is.

You’re constantly turning your car on, taking short drives and turning it off before it’s fully at operating temps. Taxis turn on and stay on. Just like generators go for many many miles because they are constantly on. Turning things on and off is what’s taxing for our cars. Also driving cars daily is good for them. Once they sit a while problems become more common.",

That's why Prius's are targets for meth-heads the nation over for the Catalytic converters because they are so much bigger to accommodate for the engine cycling up and down all the time and the increased emissions that come from that.",

They'll use the HV battery and drive motor to start the engine if it can, but if the hybrid battery is dead it'll crank the engine like a normal ICE car then immediately start charging the HV battery. I limped an 05 civic hybrid around with a bad battery for like 2 years, it'll start and be pulling power to charge for about 10min before it'll start providing any assist, by 30min into driving for the day it'd have full power and start/stop the engine using the drive motor. Overnight it's back to starting on 12v though.",

They used that car up until 2015 when my uncle traded in his old gold 1997 Mazda Protégé for a new silver Subaru Legacy to give to my grandpa. He used the Camry until iirc 2018 when my aunt went to college in Vegas after moving to the US from India after marrying my uncle. One of them drove the Camry from Washington State all the way down to Vegas (I have no idea why they didn’t do a transporter truck) when college started and back after college was done. It currently has over 260k miles on it. My uncle currently drives it as his car, but they’re thinking to replace it. He said it actually feels sketchy driving it down I-5 going above 60 as it has a bit of a pull to the right that just doesn’t go away with all the alignments and whatever they’ve done to fix it. And they just had their first child in January! They’re currently looking at the Sienna and Grand Highlander to replace the Camry. Since our family (including us) and friends love the space of minivans, and they know the advantage of minivans, I have a huge feeling they’re going to go for the Sienna. Don’t know which trim though. And by the way, my aunt drives the Subaru now. My grandpa got a gray 2018 Honda Accord new in 2018.",

Last night it withstood 40-50 mph residue from an EF0 that touched down a few miles upwind which knocked down all the trash barrels in our neighborhood. When plugged in to house power it stays inflated indefinitely. On car batter it claims  three hours. On AA batteries, one hour.",

In a blink of an eye the dealer has extra $ to make a deal with the customer.  Advertise hail sale.  But it can get dicey when the paint is cracked, lights are cracked, etc. if it isn’t totaled then the cost of repair comes a lot closer to the insurance, and customers are not as willing to say sure I’ll take a discount on my Lexus that looks like it was used for DoorDash in the Gaza Strip.",

I pulled the e break to spin the car in the snow and didn't know I was on a bridge over water. Went off the bridge, car landed upside down. I was sinking slowly, saw oil on the surface of the water and electrical I ran for the subwoofers I put in it were sparking. I panicked, tried to kick out the windshield with no success. Then stopped to think and realized I had crank windows. Car was upside down I was crawling on the roof. Water was pouring in at the tops of the windows. I cranked open the rear passenger side. Grabbed my soggy coat and swam out. Coat was too heavy to carry. Left it and crawled up shore in the mud. Started walking on a rural road in winder soaking wet. Phone was broken from water. Someone drove by and stared them left me as I yelled for help. Walked about 5 miles home. Nearly froze to death. Knocked on the door cuz keys were in the car still. Mom answered totally shocked. I eventually pulled the car out of the water. Got it running again but the interior smelled too bad to keep driving. I was sad to give it to the junk yard. They payed me $59 for it. I originally got it for $1 from my grand mother. Love those cars.",

When I said I was there to purchase the vehicle I wanted that day with $15K down. Even if I had to wait for it to come in.  They ignored me never called me back.  So I called a dealership 4 hours away, and within an hour they had a deal and the numbers completed over the phone.  I drove there that weekend walked in signed my financing paperwork, and drove the vehicle home.  Nothing can hurt them more than just simply taking money out of their pocket, and not giving them the sale.  I never give them a second chance to make that mistake again.  My local dealership has already lost two of my vehicle purchases to other dealerships because of this.  I would rather drive 4 hours to someone who actually wants my money.  My favorite is when I take my vehicle to the local dealership for the free service, and they say oh you ended up buying that vehicle somewhere else.  I smile and tell them yes they actually wanted my money.",

I’ve also shared this with my family and friends. \n\nThey treated me like a dope when I tried to buyout my lease. Pressured me to come to the dealership with incessant text messages, calls, and emails. Sent a mailer promising trade in values over KBB plus other offers. \n\nThose offers never materialized, all they did was try to sell me a new car by providing misleading payment info, keeping me there for hours, and making me feel like they’re trying to give me the deal of a lifetime, but the numbers didn’t match that sentiment. I made another post about this but they also tried to get me to sign a paper saying my mileage was 7k lower than it was (when I talked to them about trading it in. Hmmm…)\n\nSo I left without doing anything and then bought my car out using a credit union (smooth and transparent experience there). \n\nThey didn’t get to finance my car and they’re not going to get me back for maintenance. There are other places to go.",

The dealership called Lexus and explained my reason (which was true), and Lexus approved my rebate. The $500 wasn't a deal breaker. I was just explaining why I wasn't in the field. The dealership didn't hesitate to reach out to Lexus and explain. $500 is $500. I was happy to get the rebate! The rebate comes directly from Toyota. It makes no sense why the dealership wouldn't help you get that. The dealership I bought from was 500+ miles away.",

When you inquired about the graduate rebate they should have simply handed you the form, asked you to read it and fill it out if you think you qualify there's no reason for them to give you any crap. Very strange.  The only thing that could have made you ineligible for the graduate rebate is if you didn't finance directly through Toyota Financial. Also, you can not combine that rebate with any special APRs offered. So the only way you could have qualified for that rebate is  \na. The school is an accredited institution\nb. You're financing through Toyota \nc. You're financing at standard (non special) rates.",

Here's what I'd recommend:\n\nBuy Used, Avoid That Dealership:  Honestly, a dealership that treats customers like this doesn't deserve your business.  You can find amazing used Toyotas (they're super reliable) at smaller dealerships or even private sellers. You'll likely get a better deal and avoid these shady tactics.\n\nLeave a Review:  Absolutely leave a Google review for the dealership. Be factual – describe the date, the sales manager's name (if you have it), and exactly what happened regarding the rebate and contract changes. This warns other potential customers.\n\nConsider Reporting Them:\n\nToyota Corporate: Contact Toyota's customer service line. They value their reputation and may take action against a dealership with bad practices.\n\nBetter Business Bureau (BBB): File a complaint. This helps track patterns of bad behavior.\n\nDon't let this ruin your car buying experience! You deserve better.",

Went to the close dealer and  the guy tried to mark up a Prius by $10K for the model she didn't even want. When I went in with her just to see what the new Prius looks like (they are much prettier cars now), he kept talking to me and I kept telling him that this was her car and decision, better focus on her. He wouldn't budge and said that he could have this sold in the next hour at that price and she told him great for you and go ahead and do that.  \n\n\nWe went to a different dealer and got the exact color and model she wanted at sticker with a two-three week wait. The previous dealer called again later that night and offered to knock $2k off it because \"he liked her in that car\" and said he'd hold it. She told him that she already found one at the price she wants and the color/model she wants. Dude tried everything from saying the other dealer was lying to her about getting that car in (even though we saw the shipping manifest for the exact car through the Toyota stock software at both dealerships) to eventually dropping the price to $1k over sticker through several calls over the next five days (clear coat bullshit was already put on).  \n\n\nDude was an ass that tried to bully a small Hindu woman not realizing they may be some of the shrewdest shoppers/hagglers in the world. And she in particular has a VERY low threshold for these types of shenanigans ... especially from pushy, sexist dudes.",

Nothing was so sweet to tell him his competition sold me the car I wanted for the price I wanted. \n\nIf he has competition within 50 miles, try them out.",

A lot of details missing that would explain not giving someone a rebate that has zero impact on the dealer selling the car. It’s free money from the manufacturer to you with no impact on the sellers.",

Toyota dealerships are consistently low on inventory and sometimes a month of inventory has already been allocated to pre-purchasers. So really seemingly you need them more than they need you. \n\n2. There's an endemic through credit, that means people are so willing to part with their money. Money that they don't even have yet. \n\nSo the whole thing just equates to gouging customers. \n\nAnd honestly we all say the same thing, we all want to order directly from the manufacturer with the spec specific to the cars. And since we all want that seemingly we're all willing to settle for premium package of cars that we really didn't want to be in with.",

The moment I recognized this, I raised hell and got the deal we agreed on originally. I'm glad I took pictures of what I signed before they rolled out the final deal. Always do this, if they tell you not to film or photograph they're fucking high.\n\nToyota needs to look at their managers really hard and start pushing them to do the right thing. My family owns several Toyotas, but we're getting sick of the way their dealerships and partners behave when trying to make a deal happen. Personally I'm skipping the bullshit and buying online these days. You get more realistic expectations as well.",

I test drive, decide on what I want then husband comes in to test drive what I’ve narrowed down to and buy the car. It’s how I decided on the car I drive. I am the primary driver of the new car. The Toyota sales guy let me test drive one. It had black interior that I’m not used to so I asked to drive another. In the meantime, he asked would I be trading. I said possibly so. He was looking at my car and asked whose name it was in. *why does that matter for an appraisal?* once he found out I am married he no longer offered for me to test drive, he said I had to bring my husband in. Before he gave me my key back from the guy appraising it, he sat me down and what I thought was the appraiser was the manager and he kept saying “so if we find you the right car, you’ll buy from our dealership, quite possibly yet your sales guy won’t let me test drive unless my husband is with me?! It was a very haggling, chauvinistic vibe. I requested my key back and left.   As he gave me my key he said, you bring your husband back and we’ll talk. I had already been to Honda explaining I’m brand shopping and it was no problem. I also felt like I was treated like an incapable idiot. I do not feel like I was wasting his time, I’m shopping. I would never buy from Atlanta Toyota.",

We went to the dealership, negotiated the price and skipped the trade-in.  This made the sales manager say they couldn't sell it at that price.   So with a few hours invested in the process we walked.   The next day I emailed the GM and got a better deal.  \n\n\nAdvance several years.  I was time to but a 2019 RAV4.  I always have a rule that the dealership I test drive with will have an edge in the process.  So I test drove with the downtown dealership, asked the local dealer to do better, but it was the dealer at the end of the commuter train line offering $1600 off who got my business.   I left the office at 2 pm, traveled an hour, walked to the dealership, and was done by 5.",

They see dozens of customers a month—you buy a car once in several years maybe. So they know you far more than you will know them. Be demanding and take up a lot of their time. You’re not there to make friends. That’s what wins. Keep going back to the dealership and burden them to serve you. The dealers count on Americans to want to close a deal quickly and give in to their high price.  Then walk out until the next week. You can reverse their tactical advantage with persistence and by going to other Toyota dealerships and telling them the deal you’re getting from another dealership. They hate that but puts the power into your hands. Flipping seller power into buyer power. Bring an Asian looking person with you if you can. Sales people run away when they see Asians. Asians will spend the whole day negotiating $1 and takes up all the time the salespeople could spend with us dumb white guys.",

I built a relationship with a finance person at the dealership. I trade often enough that I don’t need any add-ons at financing and I want a competitive rate but I realized that cost the finance person bonus money. It’s a money business after all. I just want their best price plus no tricks or add-ons. I realized that cash on the side works wonders. I said I would give him a VERY nice thank you card once the deal was done (think $300-$500 cash). Once we did one deal that way, he became my go-to. He works everything out for me in advance. I walk in, get the papers signed and leave in my new car. Two or three days later, I drop off a thank you “card.” Some would say that shouldn’t be necessary or may even be unethical but I have found I really save money and time that way. It’s a win-win for me and the finance guy. I don‘t care about anyone else in the process because I don’t have to deal with them.  I’ve done the same with Honda dealers in the past.",

I went to look at a Highlander this Toyota dealership had listed at 20,900, and when they showed me the otd price, it jumped up to fucking 27k, mostly because of a “benefits package” they make you take. They advertise low prices to get people in the door, and then pull a bait and switch. They tried to make an excuse this, by saying the benefits package makes up the difference of what the car should be priced at. I wasn’t have that shit. I was contacted by multiple people from that dealership, and let all of them know how shitty their business practice is.",

From my experience with 4 different dealerships, however, Toyota was the worst, second to Ford. \n\nBoth of those sales guys came back with numbers focusing on payment amount, but had extended the duration of the loan to “hit my number.” \n\nI had been quite clear that I was more interested in OTD price over the amount of a monthly payment, but had made the mistake of responding to their questions about a “monthly ceiling.” So on the 2nd-3rd round of numbers they came back with a lower monthly payment that had been extended out to the maximum of 8 years or whatever.\n\nI had to recenter the point of negotiations, but with Toyota they finally got over on me, as at signing, they kept “accidentally” putting stuff back on the contract.\n\nI’d notice some $300 “scotch guard treatment” on the bill of sale and have them remove it, only to find they’d “accidentally” added back the $400 all weather floor mats or some shit. \n\nAfter the 4th printing of the contract, I saw they had again added back some “paint chip correction” bullshit for $250… but I just said to myself, “fuck it, I’m gonna pretend I didn’t see that. I just want to go *home*.”\n\nDefinitely not my proudest moment, but I had been there for 6 hours at this point, and it was worth $250 to me to just get the whole mess over with. \n\nThat also was the last Toyota I ever plan to buy, so not sure if it was a smart move from a “brand” standpoint, but hey… $250 is $250, I guess.",

I told the sales guy I was going to buy a new car THAT day and he said he'd talk tot he manager. 10 minutes later he comes back and tells me they are firm on the price. I told him I was going to walk unless they were ready to deal.\n\n I walked, went to the Mazda dealership in town and bought a car; then immediately that same afternoon went back to the Toyota dealership and showed it to the sales guy. I told him that not only did he lose the sale, but the dealership lost the future service income because I bought a completely different brand. I only wish I could have found the Sales Manager to show him. \n\nI've been in sales for 40 years selling $100K+ boxes to private people and corporations alike. I don't walk into a dealership until I've done my research and know what car I want, how much I'll pay, and what reasonable terms other dealers in the state are offering. I walk if the dealer won't meet reasonable terms in terms of price, financing, included options, removing charges for bullshit like undercoating, 'premium floor mats' etc..\n\nEven though a car will cost 35-100K these days, an automobile is still a mass-market consumer item. There are 100 other dealerships in the country with the same car. Local dealerships are fine with servicing cars bought at other dealerships, because they make more money on a long term service customer than they make on an initial sale.",

Internet car sales people are maybe one step above phishing call center people.\n\nHowever, at a Toyota dealership, the internet sales guy approached me while I was on the lot because the other sales people didn’t want to assist me because they were being dicks and all thought I wasn’t buying, he noticed from his desk inside, and took it on himself to go outside to make sure I was good. \n\nIn hindsight, his role is probably largely affected by negative internet reviews and he didn’t want that going lower due to the general sales people. \n\nBut, he was very normal and not pushy and totally knew what I was going for and he dedicated some time the next few days to locate the car I wanted locally and get it allocated to his dealer for me. Probably my best experience at a dealer because Mitsubishi was HORRIBLE when I bought an Evo 😂",

Even though I already had a checking account with them, I had no idea this existed.\n\nI applied for a car loan and agreed to the terms. Then the car buyer (whose office is right there) called me and asked me what I wanted. She was not there to tell me what to buy. Her main job was to find a car in my area and I would agree to buy it. (The car is delivered to the Credit Union)\n\nIn 2022, there were so little cars and I was taking the bus. After the car buyer calling me for months with various cars, I finally decided on the Corolla Cross. She told me when to come to the credit union and they sent an Uber to pick me up.\n\nOnce I was at the credit union,  I saw the car, looked it over and said yes. 100% of the paper work, loan was done right there. Zero negotiations on price though. The price was given to me over the phone prior to agreeing to see the car.\n\nFor me, the relief was in zero dealership nonsense. I cannot even tell you how EASY this all was. ZERO pressure. I could have walked out in the middle and they could have cared less as well as understood.\n\nNow I have learned that most credit unions have thee same kind of programs including rural community credit unions. Definitely check it out. Let me know if you have any other questions. I do not mind helping as no one around me in my family would help me.",

There's nothing holding a dealership back from giving it to you if they have the inventory and the lease offer is available in that region and the customer qualifies. \n\n\nI sold Toyota for 5 years and ran into a few guys that came in with math they got from lease hacker and helped them all get a car. They were all very nice actually. They definitely saved money from me vs. Getting it from the broker. Also lease hacker did a great job teaching them about the finance manager before they came in so they didn't buy shit from the finance guy lol.",

They are a form of communication to the other potential customers. If you want to talk to the manager, be an adult and talk to a manager.  A review on human interaction is only necessary if it's a repetitive thing. Like if the service member or receptionist or salesperson was rude to you on multiple visits and its a common thing sure let people know the truth. But a single interaction that he didn't like and he didn't buy anything or provide any patronage? Sorry that's not deserving of a review.  Sounds like I hit a bees nest in this sub and those bees are a bunch of grown ups who forgot or never learned how to communicate their needs to another adult like grown ups. Instead you rather fold into our Karen shells and waste your time writing a review when you could just communicate better in the first place. ",

This is literally the entire experience at a dealership, and it is what you should be reviewing.\n\nThe review page of Bobby Bob's Toyota Extravaganza is not the place to review a Toyota, because the dealership doesn't make the car. Toyota does. So what else is there to review? Oh yeah, the employees and your interactions with the employees.\n\nShould you *also* talk to a manager? Sure. But everyone should still know that you had to do this, because it's literally the reviewable material.\n\nYou have created such a mental maze to get from point A to point B here, that I can only go back to my original point and assume you're mad about the ability for people to call out the liars and scam artists that have made car dealerships the most unnecessarily stressful and exhausting consumer experience in the US. I cannot wait for the tears that will flow in July when half of this stuff becomes straight up illegal.\n\nAlso, just revisiting this:\n\n>Like if the service member or receptionist or salesperson was rude to you on multiple visits and its a common thing sure let people know the truth. But a single interaction that he didn't like and he didn't buy anything or provide any patronage?\n\nMost people don't visit a dealership multiple times to make a purchase. You're basically arguing that you can't complain until you've bought multiple cars. But given that the average length of car ownership is 8 years, what are the chances the same employees even work there the second time you go in? What are the chances you go to the same dealership? How bizarre.\n\nBut this specifically:\n\n>he didn't buy anything or provide any patronage?\n\nYou're also arguing that if a dealer makes your experience so awful that you don't buy the car, you shouldn't tell anyone about that, either. How bizarre. A dealership that scams 100% of its customers would only have 5 star reviews, because anyone who catches on to the scam and leaves shouldn't be allowed to review the dealership - thereby increasing the number of people likely to fall prey to the scam. Again, I'm seeing where the anger comes from.",

Eventually I was able to get a refund (they eventually offered to either refund or resend, but said they would not refund if it got lost again), so I told them to refund me. They got a 2 star review on Google. 2 only because there was a resolution. In other words, the manager may not give you shit, because I had been dealing with the internet parts manager for weeks. I eventually was able to speak to a higher manager, and would have been fully prepared to take it to the dealership manager.",

Talking to a live human who can help you is that outlet. I know that's difficult to understand.   \n\n\nBelieve it or not, if you're like OP and want something, you can just be direct and ask for it. You can actually handle things in real life without pulling out your phone or going online to voice your opinion. You can even handle things like this without going on Reddit and getting attention. It's called speaking directly with a GM. What's hilarious is, that's the end point anyway. People like you just want to waste time, getting the business to be apologetic and grovel at your feet because you get off on the way it makes you feel. You don't actually want a resolution. You want attention and to be cottled. \n\n\nA lot of Americans are like you these days. It doesn't surprise me.  My favorite customers to work with were foreign immigrants. They were all SO MUCH better at communicating than Americans. If you want to learn how to be polite AND get the best deal just watch an Indian buy a car. ",

But I don't imagine the equation has changed too much!  \n\n\nThat car...I didn't appreciate it then, but it really is the perfect people mover. We moved house several times in that thing, it went across the country without skipping a beat...it was just a tough old thing. Spacious too, that's what gets me about certain SUV's, it feels like I'm flying coach when I'm with others. But the Sienna...its the closest I'd get to flying Lear...comfort-wise, of course!  \nI was honestly baffled when she got an Mitsubishi Outlander as our new people-mover, besides the fact it was cheaper. She has gushed about the Sienna, and was very saddened when it was finally done-in by a collision, though thankfully my sister (the driver and sole occupant) walked away uninjured. And let me tell you, that Mitsubishi...its not Toyota tough.  \n\n\nIf we could swing the money on it, oh, I'd get her something like that car again. If not a Sienna, then something that'll, all the same, always be there for us.",

Looks like they charged you 45 to mount and balance a single tire…For reference, I usually pay 70-80 for all for corners….It’s crazy how they get away with this stuff and even crazier to think how much extra revenue they pull annually from doing this shady shit.",

Job 2 looks to be an oil change, rotate, and an additive that might be like a fuel induction service to help with clearing carbon buildup. In labor, that seems about on par at a dealership and probably could get that closer to 90 at a Indy shop. As for the battery, I’ve learned when a customer replaces their battery they typically don’t let the vehicle power down long enough to let the battery monitoring system to reset. If you don’t let it reset the power shedding continues to think that you have an old battery and shuts down systems much earlier than they need to. Hence the 82.50 to replace your battery. They reset your BMS as well as cleaned up the terminals that connect to the battery.\n\nYou certainly could do most of these things yourself at home, but if you are going to the dealer you are going for a premium.",

I started doing my own maintenance and I have saved thousands from just doing oil changes and tire rotations. If you drive a highlander hybrid, there are going to be extra things Toyota adds into every service to “extend the life of the vehicle because of its unique hybrid system”.\n\nDealerships will rape you on charges for what seems to be simple tasks that can probably be done at home for a fraction of the cost, I highly recommend that everyone learn how to do oil changes, tire rotations, balancing, and fuel additives on their own. An hour or 2 of YouTube videos and a couple hundred bucks starting cost will save you thousands in the long run, especially if you have multiple vehicles. Some things just cannot be done easily like changing the tire on a rim and may be easier just to take to a dealership, which is completely understandable.\n\nTo answer your question, yes.\n\nEdit - Did you buy your car new? If so the battery might be covered under the standard factory warranty of 36 months/36,000.",

I’d assume they just replaced it with the same model but for what I’m assuming is a $185 USD battery, you absolutely could’ve gotten a much better battery for that price (at least in Canada, for equivalent costs). \n\nI understand the convenience of paying for oil changes, but a battery replacement is as simple as loosening 2 or 3 bolts, swapping the battery, and simply retightening those same 2-3 bolts. It’s absolutely worth your time to learn this 5 minute job and it’s kinda disturbing that they’re charging you $82 for something THAT simple.",

        "comment_body": "I am a parts manager at a Toyota Dealer in Canada, so some insight from the other end, which may help. Most of the wording is verbatim (copy paste), inspect of mats, rotation if needed, etc. However I see several items that are NOT Toyota recommended services. Some things look good and correct. Tire change is just what it is, they billed like .2 or .3 for it, standard for a single pulling off the car etc. Price is not that competitive probably, but you didn't get hosed, depending on the tire brand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Good;\n\nThe oil change looks bog standard, Toyota OEM crush washer for the drain plug, and Toyota OEM filter, at actual Toyota MSRP. The oil doesn't say if its Toyota Genuine, My dealer gets the correct TGMO (Toyota Genuine Motor Oil) from the bulk supplier, Mobil in Canada. I know some dealers take what is cheapest by shopping suppliers. Not a big deal. 0W16 oil is all synthetic. The battery is an OEM H5 EFB, for stop-start applications, the price looks correct compared to CAD, a good battery all in all made by East Penn, They OEM several and seem to very good, Toyota in Canada at least offers 84 month warranty on those.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Bad;\n\nThere is no such thing as oil conditioning in Toyota-Land, same with ethanol fuel system treatment or oil additive. These are real products maybe, they likely did add them to your vehicle. They serve no purpose. They are purely a cash-cow snake oil service offered by dealers and propagated by BG (chemical supplier) They generally give massive kick backs over (or under) the table directly to service managers / business owners in addition to massive markup they carry to begin with to sell them. The fuel systems are designed to function with ethanol. Good quality synth 0w16 has no issue going 10k miles. That being said there is no harm in doing 5k mile changes, which appears to be what they are doing anyways, the Toyota schedule is 10k / 1 year for this vehicle. Even then oil additives, cleaning / flushes are pointless and borderline pure scam.\n\nRefuse these services and if they wont remove them or not do them. Find another Toyota dealer. One thing no-one else noticed yet I believe is the \"Battery Sv Kit\" There is nothing to service when changing the battery, and that part number is not a Toyota part number. It is likely some BG junk again.  \n\n\nThe odd?\n\n$132 for labour for the oil change seems mighty high to me personally, especially USD, I believe they are adding extra time for the junk services. I'd guess it's no more than 0.3 or 0.4 hours billed for a normal Oil change. (1hr for me $155 CAD, so 0.4 would be $62, we charge $45) \n\nI did the math between the battery time and oil change time and come up with $165 an hour shop rate. About $222 CAD which seems very high to me... Ours is $155, about $115 USD",

I’m pretty sure all Toyota’s pull from the same tire dealer, which should only be $27.50 per tire to mount, balance, & install plus tax if applicable of course. Note: almost curious what their labor rate is. $132 for the 35K labor seems steep.",

Free replacement for 3 years and then prorated for the next 3 years. Best part is they drive to where it failed for replacement so no concern about getting it to which ever shop sold you a battery/warranty. I’ve had success with them before and yet to have an issue with warranty replacements",

        "comment_body": "I believe brand new toyotas are a scam.\n\nI will only drive European luxury cars from now on\n\nBrand new Toyotas are way too expensive now. They are coming to European luxury car price territory. They used to be worth it when it costed like 19K for a brand new Camry back in 2015. \n\nI bought a brand new e tron premium plus in 2021 for 49K. I got 25% off MSRP and claimed the EV TAX credit. After 39 months of ownership I only lost about 9K. 250 bucks a month. I paid 500 for my first 20000 mile maintenance then I paid 250 for my 30000 mile maintenance. \n\nI heard Toyotas have to be serviced every 10K miles as well and that the service costs around the same. \n\nMy point is u drive a car for 15 years ur gonna loose the same amount of money. It’s 45K for a RAV4 hybrid brand new  right now and Toyota dealers don’t knock down price either MSRP or markup. So my friend bought a RAV4 hybrid for 45K in 2021. I told him to buy my car instead he’s like reliability it holds value better. It’s worth 31000 dollars today. 14000/37 months of ownership is 378 a month lost. Fine the car will last 15 years at most that’s 300 a month. Plus no one drives a car for a long time anymore a lot of people get a new car after 7-10 years. \n\nI change cars every 2-3 years I will buy another new luxury EV on heavy markdown and will not face a lot of depreciation. \n\nIf we were both to finance I would be holding my equity better. \n\nPlus I have more respect when I roam in my car from the public since I look more wealthy and I stay wealthy since I don’t make stupid financial decisions. Plus I actually feel excited when I drive and get compliments when I roam in my car. \n\nIk imma get downvoted. \n\nTake a look at a 2023 2022 CPO Audi Q5 safer car. It’s only 35-40K. I had it as a loaner got 29.6 MPG I was shocked. \n\nMaintanence costs r about the same it’s not a lot more but a little more. I heard Toyota sometimes charges a lot for maintenance like for instance up there. Maintainence is really not a lot. Whenever an Audi has a small problem and it’s in the warranty time frame the cost is covered by the dealer. Plus they give ya a loaner. \n\nLike I said Ik I will get downvoted just saw in my feed wanna educate u all. Luxury cars can be negotiated down by a lot where u barely see any depreciation.",

What is \"oil cleaner\" and \"oil additive\"??  Why would a car with 35K miles need this stuff?    How often do you change your oil?  Ignore the idiotic 10,000 mile recommendation, change it every 5000 miles.  What the heck is a \"battery service kit\"?  What model toyota do you have?  $256 seems pretty expensive for a tire, unless it is a special performance tire.  \n\nThe dealer will do their best to sell you expensive \"service packages\" with big names, that really don't involve much of any labor.  So, the price seems a little high, depending on your location and the price of labor.  I'm thinking you probably would have paid $200 less for this work if it had been done at an independent shop.",

You didn’t “get got”, you took care of your car. If someone buys the oil additive and induction service (recommended every 20k or 3 air filter changes) we always consider that guy a smart car owner. We aren’t chucking behind your back. No, it’s not necessary, but it’s like going to shell for gas even tho it’s more expensive.\nBG is a huge rep and make great stuff. \nBG Is the first company to team with a Manufacturer (GM) to make a GM X BG air induction service. They’re legit. Their warranties are legit. I’ve seen whole engines covered due to them always getting MOA (oil fortifier) with their OC’s.\n\n\nTire was whatever, but typically dealerships will have price matching even AFTER the fact. Find that part number, cross reference discount tire (no wholesalers like Walmart or Costco, typically, but depends on dealership) and you can get some money back if you’re really worried. \n\n\nThe battery, yeah you could get it cheaper but Toyota brand warranties I believe are 84months. So if you’re over that, yeah you’ll pay for the battery but if not, it should’ve been warrantied out. But keep your receipt IN YOUR CAR for the battery, and within 84 months take it to ANY Toyota dealership to get it replaced.\n\nYou did good 👍 I’d be a happy guy if I bought a car and knew the owner took care of it as well as you are.",

The battery you can easily replace yourself, and Rural King sells them new usually for around $100 or less. And I'm sure a lot of ppl will disagree with this, but I prefer buying goodyear tires from Walmart and try to do It during their Black Friday sale. Under $500 for 4 brand new Goodyear tires, installed for 215/55r17s. To me changing all 4 is the only way to do it, but it's okay to replace them as you need to.",

Yeah. \nKeep in mind the good thing about having work done at the dealer is if there are any problems with the parts or worked performed they can’t say “well you should have had it done by certified technicians”. Also dealerships have to pay manufacturers a bunch and that trickles down to all the costs and the higher prices a lot of times. \nI personally always go to the dealership for the piece of mind and know it’s going to cost. But I also know enough to not get ripped off by things they upsell like oil additives etc.",

It was $500 cheaper for all 4 at discount tire and that was with the free tire rotations. The dealership charged her like $40 every 5k miles to rotate the tires. Once I showed her that, she now only buys at discount tire. Plus, one time I was in high school and my tire got a nail in it. Toyota dealer said I had to replace it for a new one because it wasn’t repairable. Told them to put it back on and I drove it to discount tire, they straight up said the dealer lied and they repaired it for free despite not buying the tire from them. \n\nTLDR: Go to a dedicated tire shop for tire repairs and replacements. NEVER go to the dealership for those items.",

Still a lot but they are really good tires (yes Michelin would be slightly better but I was going for  quietest and softest ride with wet handling. Everything else is secondary).",

To give the dealerships some credit, they don't purchase tires in bulk like a tire warehouse type store. They don't have the ability to provide those types of prices. Their technicians are a bit higher tier and higher paid than technicians at a tire shop. This all equates to higher prices. It's really about convenience with a dealership. Some people that make a good income find a lot of convenience in having tires replaced at the same time as an oil change. For most of us, we find our way to discount tire or Costco.",

Never looked up what were the issues for my year. I should have. The great stealer dealer never saw the issue when it was under warranty, but suddenly it became really important some 10,000 miles AFTER it was off warranty. It would cost now $4,000 to do the repair now. They knew there was a problem while it was under warranty and they decided to ignore it. So now, I never trust dealers and whatever needs to be done I get an estimate to at least 3 dealers and 2 independent garages. \nPrices are wildly different at different dealers, at times 50-60% the cost of one dealer. It’s mind blowing. \n\nThe Carlsbad Toyota dealer is such a crook. One time, we had 4-month old tires bought and free installed at Costco. The stealership was adamant that we needed new tires and they had the tread depth to prove it!! Not. They always pick something that one cannot check easily and without proof, like need air intake carbon buildup cleaning, etc. \n\nGo to an independent garage that works or mainly focus on Toyota and you will be much better off than the stealership. Just make sure to ask and verify that you get OEM parts, otherwise they’ll go cheap on you.",

You can get one almost anywhere and you should be in their system.  I keep a photo copy of the receipt in my glove box and write the install date on the battery so you know how much life you got out of it.  I usually average 4 to 5 years for a 12v battery.

Easy things like wiper blades, batteries, washer fluid, air filter, and in-cabin filter are easy to replace on your own and should never be performed by the dealership. Some will do complimentary items like washer fluid and wiper blades but Toyota is notorious for their “no free lunch” policy.\n\nWhen dealing with tires check local prices.

First, open your owners manual and read the section on maintenance. Second, from this point forward follow the maintenance schedule to a T. The company that designed and built your vehicle also specified its maintenance schedule. I guarantee that nowhere in that manual will you find a need for  any oil, coolant, power steering or transmission additives. In fact, you will likely find that Toyota specifically warns against the use of these wallet flushing additives. Most automotive fluids are a carefully engineered package of base oils and additives, and upsetting that balance will at a minimum unnecessarily lighten your wallet. Using quality oils, fluids and filters that meet the specifications called for by Toyota is all you really need to do.",

        "comment_body": "I can’t speak for other brands but I’ve only serviced my Toyota and Lexus vehicles at dealerships. And over the past 15 years I’ve had 14 different cars and serviced them at 10 Toyota dealerships and 2 Lexus dealerships in Texas and 2 Toyota dealerships in California. For repair or service that was not an oil change, I always call about 3 dealers to get a quote on what they charge, each one is drastically different. For example, my Yaris original front and rear brake pads needed replacing at 160,000 miles. I was quoted $400, $450, and $300 ($350 with a $50 dealer coupon). Those were all within a 15 mile radius. I also have many friends that work at Toyota and Lexus dealers and they also recommend shopping around for dealer service and also never buy tires from the dealer unless you want to pay more. So yes your experience and competitive pricing can be different than mine since my experiences are primarily in a major city within Texas. However, you prove to me that it’s cheaper to get new tires at a dealer than say a tire chain like discount tire and ntb. Please consider dealer charges for alignment, balancing, 5k mile tire rotations, tire repair costs. All these services are free if you buy the tires at discount tire and purchase the certificates. I’m an automotive accountant by trade and I go through these extensive cost analysis for any service on my car. I track my total cost of ownership for the time I own each of my cars (insurance, maintenance, repairs, depreciation, gas fill-ups, tires/wearables, miscellaneous).",

Slow down.😂 I honestly would love to make a compilation of all the “toyota’s noncommittal stance to BEV is appalling” quotes.\n\nLook at the end of the day, passenger vehicles are consumer goods. If we want people to adopt (aside from some of us willing to make the full BEV jump) proper incentives must be in place. Most people are not comfortable rocking 180-216 miles of range on a BEV, most people aren’t accustomed to working with charging stations on road trips. Thus the best way to get people there is the hybrid power electric vehicle. \n\nMy partner’s model 3 is a comfortable car but we end up taking my UX hybrid on longer trips in the midwest. If the temperatures aren’t above 50 degrees frankly we park the model 3. The compromise in convenience is too great for MOST people.\n\nToyota is just showing the average redditor that they know a little bit more about the average consumer than we do.",

The mining industry and its harmful effects behind the mass production of *extremely* inefficient and unreliable battery tech is just as bad if not worse than most gasoline engines.

And battery tech absolutely sucks and it progresses so slowly. Battery electric cars suck in cold weather, the batteries wear out, tend to catch on fire or be explosive, and the heavy metals involved are so bad. Each electric car has to last seven years before it even breaks even on offsetting its own production. \n\nToyota is pioneering hydrogen combustion for example not only because it’ll help Japan in its quest to be energy independent, being the number one producer of hydrogen, but we can simply adapt combustion engines and their fueling infrastructure to switch the fuel source to hydrogen, which while inefficient to produce now, will likely progress rapidly and is wayyy cleaner than the process of making and recycling batteries. It’s already progressing way faster than battery tech.",

Their engine blocks, cams, cranks piston rods and connecting parts are all capable of delivering 3x the horsepower they do in the end. \n\nSo in essence even at redline, they are only running 30% of their capacity.  The engine is never stressed even under load.  So they just don’t wear out for a long long time. \n\nFor example the engine in my 2005 Sequoia, a 4.7L V8. Makes about 280hp. \n\nThey sold as an option from the dealer a supercharger that added 100hp.   They didn’t even change any other parts.   It just made 100 more horsepower… under warranty. \n\nOther manufacturers make turbo and super charged engines of course, but they often have to be specially upgraded to handle it.  Stronger parts. \n\nThe Toyota gets the stronger parts from the factory by default.",

If any of their technicians or engineers find a problem, no matter how big or small, they halt production on all of the cars with that problem, they fix it, fix the cars that aren’t shipped yet, recall the ones that already shipped, and continue production. Every single other brand will let the issues roll past, and if it makes enough sense financially wise to issue a recall (as in, if the amount of extra money spent in recalling will save more money compared to lawsuit payouts), or NHTSA gets involved, only then do they fix those problems. This is *why* Toyotas generally have no problems within 150K miles (their typical warranty period).",

My dad bought it right before I started high school so we could learn to drive stick. it’s really fun to drive, not just because of the manual but it handles very well. The transmission sounds horrible but it still works, and it’s kind of falling apart on the inside, but no major issues. I’ve done maintenance items (coolant, spark plugs, drive belts, etc) over the past several years but that’s about it. Unfortunately, you can tell that there is a quality difference between Mazda and Toyota. Mazdas plastics are inferior, from the valve cover to the interior panels, they aren’t as solid. They also don’t use the best designs (direct injection only, oil control valve that you have to remove the valve cover to replace, cabin filter in a horrible location, etc). Not to say that Toyotas designs and serviceability are perfect, but Toyota seems to keep that in mind a lot more. Also, for whatever reason Mazdas tend to show rust underneath a lot more. That Mazda my brother drives has NEVER lived up north, it has more rust than my GX which was up there when it was brand new for several years. And not by a litttle, surface rust everywhere. I’ve heard this is the case with Mazdas, but didn’t notice until recently. ",

There is also the cx-90 which is a new platform (3.3?L turbocharged inline 6 w/ 8 speed automatic) and has had a stop sale for a power steering issue.\n\nOverall I'd rather drive the older platform that's proven reliable over time (both manufacturers at this point to me) with the nicer interior. (Also the Mazda rotary nob for the infotainment looks odd and hard to use but it's not after figuring it out)",

I had a ‘16 Mazda 6 GT that I traded in when the new Tundra came out. 150k miles with nothing besides basic maintenance and no sign that anything was near needing replacement. I honestly wish I kept that car. I would consider Mazdas to be very reliable since ‘15 and onward and I can’t imagine buying something that isn’t a Toyota/Lexus or Mazda at this point.",

Just last week I bought two 6ft tall bookcases and a buffet table and brought them home in her 😂\n\nIt’s really the perfect commuter car, it gets such good gas mileage, is reliable as hell, and cheap maintenance. So easy to work on too if you wanted to try doing smaller stuff yourself, like oil changes or spark plugs!",

To push for more MPGs they loosen up the piston rings and switch to thinner oil which is a recipe for oil consumption issues.",

It has currently 179K miles  and doesn't seem to burn any oil or that I noticed between 5000 mile oil changes, but I do need to change the valve cover and oil pan gasket soon since I noticed a little seeping....  I'll do that soon after I get the water pump, radiator, thermostat and radiator hoses changed soon in the next few months... I guess the 2005 2AZ-FE was a good engine before they ruined it in 2006 and updated the piston rings for slightly more MPGs since I noticed back then the 2006 scion tC could get a little more MPGs back then.\n\nHere's a good video on what are the best engines that Toyota Produced and the worse engines.. from The Car Care Nut...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OJkjE2-O3wo?si=trWoBukE518A6LSz",
